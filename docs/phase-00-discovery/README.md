# Phase 0: Discovery

> Research, requirements gathering, and project definition for EA Platform.

## Documents in This Phase

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [PRD.md](PRD.md) | Product Requirements Document - problem, users, features, value proposition |
| [USER-PERSONAS.md](USER-PERSONAS.md) | Detailed profiles of our 4 user types |
| [SUCCESS-METRICS.md](SUCCESS-METRICS.md) | KPIs and success criteria by launch phase |

| [COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md](COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md) | German market competitors and positioning |

## Research Files

The `research/` folder contains 14 detailed analysis documents from the Bridebook wedding platform study. These inform our platform design while being adapted for the entertainment/artist marketplace.

### Domain Mapping

The research is based on a wedding planning platform. Here's how the concepts map to EA Platform:

| Bridebook Concept | EA Platform Equivalent |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Vendors | Artists + Venues |
| Couples | Organizers (B2B) + Customers (B2C) |
| Weddings | Events / Gigs |
| Wedding Planning | Event Planning |
| Enquiries | Booking Requests |
| Favorites | Saved Artists/Venues |
